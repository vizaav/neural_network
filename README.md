# Neural Network

A simple neural network in Python. It accurately detects languages based on just letters from the Latin alphabet from the input (preferably a long-ish sentence). It means that rather than spotting characters typical for a language, it analyses the frequency of each letter.

It can detect any language which uses Latin alphabet, as long as a directory and a good share of data is provided. I decided to set the number of eras manually due to a large number of training text - that way I had more control over training time. A simple GUI was made using Tkinter.
