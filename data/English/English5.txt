ENGLISH

Amidst the hills and valleys green,
Where nature's beauty is serene,
The wind whispers a melody,
That echoes through the woods so free.

The trees sway in a rhythmic dance,
As if in a trance, a mystic romance,
With the earth that nurtures and feeds,
Their roots that spread, like woven beads.

The sun shines bright in a sky so blue,
Painting the landscape with a golden hue,
As if a canvas, a masterpiece to view,
A tapestry of colors, so vibrant and new.

The birds chirp and sing a song so sweet,
A symphony of nature, a musical treat,
Their feathers shine, like jewels in the light,
A sight to behold, a true delight.

The rivers flow, like veins through the land,
Their currents strong, like a guiding hand,
Carrying life, in its purest form,
Nurturing growth, through calm and storm.

The animals roam, wild and free,
A part of nature's tapestry,
Their instincts sharp, their senses keen,
A world so wild, yet so serene.

The stars twinkle, in the night so still,
A cosmic dance, a magical thrill,
A universe so vast, yet so close,
A source of wonder, and endless dose.

The moonlight shines, in a silver beam,
A mystical glow, a mystic dream,
A light so pure, so calm and serene,
A world so bright, yet so unseen.

Amidst this world of beauty and grace,
Of wonders and mysteries, in every space,
We stand in awe, of nature's might,
Of a world so pure, so full of light.

For in this world, we find our place,
Our home, our refuge, our saving grace,
A world so fragile, yet so strong,
A world we cherish, and belong.

So let us cherish, this world so dear,
And protect it, from every fear,
For it is our home, our source of life,
A world so beautiful, so full of light.

In the midst of hills and valleys drear,
Where nature's beauty is lost and unclear,
The wind moans a melody,
That echoes through the woods so eerie.

The trees sway in a dismal dance,
As if in a trance, a somber romance,
With the earth that rots and decays,
Their roots that spread, like a diseased maze.

The sun glares down in a sky so grey,
Painting the landscape with a sickly display,
As if a canvas, a ghastly sight,
A tapestry of colors, so dull and blight.

The birds screech and caw a song so bleak,
A cacophony of nature, a horrid shriek,
Their feathers dull, like dust in the light,
A sight to abhor, a true fright.

The rivers flow, like poison through the land,
Their currents toxic, like a deadly brand,
Carrying death, in its vilest form,
Nurturing decay, through every storm.

The animals crawl, diseased and pained,
A part of nature's tapestry, so stained,
Their instincts dulled, their senses seared,
A world so vile, yet so feared.

The stars flicker, in the night so dark,
A cosmic dance, a macabre mark,
A universe so vast, yet so cruel,
A source of horror, and endless fuel.

The moonlight glows, in a sickly beam,
A ghastly light, a demonic dream,
A light so corrupt, so foul and obscene,
A world so grim, yet so unseen.

Amidst this world of ugliness and woe,
Of horrors and mysteries, in every throes,
We stand in fear, of nature's blight,
Of a world so sick, so devoid of light.

For in this world, we find our despair,
Our doom, our demise, our final snare,
A world so fragile, yet so wrong,
A world we curse, and do not belong.

So let us abhor, this world so dire,
And neglect it, with every mire,
For it is our doom, our source of strife,
A world so repulsive, so devoid of life.
